main classes:

DW_graph implement DirectedWeightedGraph: ####The class represents a basic graph structure, and allows:

add node
remove node
connect 2 node with edge
remove edge
Iterator
Data structure
nodes
children - all edges in origin point
parents - all edges in reverse point
DW_graph_algo implement DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms: ####The class implements algorithms for use on the graph:

isConnected(): check if graph is strongly connected.
shortestPathDist(): find shortest path distance between 2 nodes.
shortestPath(): find shortest path between 2 nodes.
center(): find center node in graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_center)
tsp():Computes a list of consecutive nodes which go over all the nodes in cities. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
